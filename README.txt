The pulse tutorial is an IPython Notebook meant to be opened within the IBM Quantum Lab environment. 
It was created as part of a master's thesis in physics, focused on implementing cloud-based quantum 
computing in physics education at a university level.

The pulse tutorial has the style of an inquiry-based learning envorionment, designed to teach 
undergraduate physics students the concepts of time-dependent perturbation theory. It was created 
specifically for the course "Quantum Mechanics 2" at the University of Copenhagen.

To realise the full potential of the pulse tutorial, download the .ipynb-file of this repository and
upload it to the IBM Quantum Lab environment. New users will be asked to make an account. From there, 
the black box functions within the pulse tutorial will allow users to run pulse experiments on real 
quantum computer backends.
